For Udacity's [AI for Trading](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-for-trading--nd880) Nanodegree.

Topic: Momentum Trading.

## Overview
* Generating a trading signal based on a momentum indicator, computing it for a given time range, and applying it to a dataset to estimate projected returns.
* Finally, you will perform a statistical test on the mean of the returns to conclude if there is alpha in the signal. For the dataset, we'll be using the end of day from Quotemedia.

## Concepts
* Using Pandas to resample end-of-day stock prices to a dataframe of end-of-month prices.
* Implementing Python methods that:
    * Return the best and worst performing stocks in a given time period.
    * Calculate expected portfolio returns of longing the best stocks and shorting the worst ones.
* Calculating the T-statistic and its corresponding p-value, and using it to determine whether the expected portfolio returns were or were not due to random chance.
